the equestrian riots lasted a millenia, how long does it take to burn down a mueseum? well the hooves certainly make it hard to use matches, so they have my sympathy.

I can't stop them. I can't stop them.

They have evolved fingers

-not a good time. Stop.

Time is not consecutive.

Also this aaaaah

This is....

I've heard of Steven Hawking's idea of hosting a party and then sending the invites after. I have an idea where you write your time and location on a piece of paper, then you seal it up and bury it into the ground. Obviously, you would have to protect the piece of paper and make sure it's readable in a million years or whenever someone who can time travel finds it. But let's say someone finds it in however long... and they're a time traveler or knows a time traveler and they would visit the location and time. So I think if you were to plant a piece of paper or a book into the ground, a time traveler could show up when your planting it. Do you guys agree? Or is this stupid? If everyone in the world were to do this it would increase the odds of one of them being found and if someone shows up while it's being planted... could it be possible that this confirms time travel?
